## About the images

The root filesystem tarballs for the images is auto-generated weekly at 22:30 UTC on Sunday in Github infrastructure using [Github actions](https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch-docker/blob/master/.github/workflows/scheduled-docker-publish.yml).

### Special note about the novnc image

You need to run the container with the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` options, otherwise, it will fail. See https://gitlab.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal/-/issues/116 and https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker/issues/346 for details.

## Availability

Root filesystem tarballs are provided by Github Actions and are **only** available for 1 week once the new build is triggered.

## Updating

BlackArch Linux is a rolling release distribution, so a full update is recommended when installing new packages. In other words, we suggest either execute RUN `pacman -Syu` immediately after your FROM statement or as soon as you docker run into a container.
